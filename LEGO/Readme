A Comprehensive Study Of Lego Product Trends And Market Dynamics
Author: Zichen Zhou, Xin Lei, Thanh Tra Ngo

This project delved into the historical progression of LEGO sets and themes, while also examining the advancement in product complexity and the refinement in the usage of colour palettes. Additionally, this study investigated the variations in retail and resale prices of LEGO products over time, focusing on the themes with the highest values in the secondary market. Moreover, predictive models for LEGO resale prices were established, allowing for an intricate exploration of the factors that impact these market values.

Raw datasets of this project come from 3 sources:
(1) Rebrickable dataset
• colors.csv
• inventories.csv
• inventory_parts.csv • sets.csv
• themes.csv
(2) Brickset dataset
• brickset_set.csv
(3) Kaggle dataset
• kaggle_sets.csv

Cleanned data includes:
• product_data.csv
• colour_data.csv
• market_data.csv
• model_data.csv
• final_model_data.csv
• final_model_data._log.csv
