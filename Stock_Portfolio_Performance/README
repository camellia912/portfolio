This is my individual project for the Computer Programming course, part of the Master of Applied Data Science program at the University of Canterbury.

This program is built with 2 major objectives: (i) analyzing individual stock performance and (ii) analyzing stock portfolio performance. For this program, the top ten stocks with the highest market capitalization from the New Zealand Stock Exchange were selected for analysis. After defining the stock list, the historical price dataset will be extracted from Yahoo!Finance.
