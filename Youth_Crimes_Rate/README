This is my individual project for the Introduction to Data Science course, part of the Master of Applied Data Science program at the University of Canterbury.

This study examined trends in New Zealandâ€™s youth offending between 2015 and 2022. The raw data related to the ethnicity and age groups of offenders in New Zealand was sourced from policedata.nz, specifically under the "Proceedings (Offenders Demographics)" category and the "Demographics" tab. Access to this information is available on the New Zealand Police website. The dataset covers an 8-year period, spanning from 2015 to 2022.
